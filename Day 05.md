HW
---------------------------------------
Tons of good stuff! Great ideas! Lots more work! Keep going!

1. **Research jQuery Plug-Ins**

	Find five plugins that *could* be incorporated into the your Project 1 site. There are a couple good reference links at the bottom of this email if you don't know where to look. You don't have to use them, but I want you to at least be aware of what's out there. Post links to all five, along with descriptions of how they could fit into the interactivity of your narrative.


3. **Refine Designs**

	Combine the best of your ideas, make them better, and turn them into at least three of your pages. As always, post these to the blog.


3. **Print Comps**

	Even if you aren't done, print out a couple of your pages to markup as annotated comps. These may be more tricky than normal, so it's extra important we do these right.

### Discuss designing for mobile

based on concepts from [A user-centered approach to mobile design](http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2011/05/02/a-user-centered-approach-to-mobile-design/)

- Context
	- What is the context people use their mobile devices in?
	- How long do people browse on their phones?
	- What sort of time commitment can we expect from a mobile user?

- Users
	- Who would you think the average mobile user is? 
	- What is their tech literacy like?
	- What do they want from an online site?

- Affordances
	- What are some of the affordances of viewing a site on a mobile device?
	- How does using our fingers affect navigation? Button sizes?
	- What about hover states? What about dragging content?
	- How do mobile users get access to hidden content?
	- What are the features of a mobile device screen?
	- Font-sizes?
	- Portrait vs. landscape?


### To prepare for group discussions, answer these questions individually and post them to the blog:
- What is the primary objective of your site? Do you have other goals?
- Who is your audience?
- What is the overall tone that you want to convey?
- What is the main form of interaction you want to explore? (How can you express your subject through click-and-drag? scrolling? click-and-hold?)
- How can the user express him/herself within a site about your subject?
- Is there a particular environment/context that your site would be best in?


### Group Crits
Split up into groups, discuss designs



HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Refine Designs**
	
	Take the designs you worked on since last week, pick your favorite, and then start to refine it. As I always say, you can change things later, but for next class, at least come with a design that *could* be a final draft.

2. **Mobile Design Comps**â€¨	
	After your designs are finished, it won't be much to turn your comps into a mobile version. I just want to see one 'page' converted, and it definitely doesn't have to be complete, but I want to see that you're applying the mobile design factors we discussed into your designs. I say don't spend more than half an hour on this, unless you want to.

3. **Print Your Design Comps**

	Print out copies of both your full-size and mobile design comps and bring them to class. We'll be using these to mark up with annotations, so they don't have to be in color or full quality, but they should be at 100% size.

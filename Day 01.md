HW
---------------------------------------

And we're off! Heavy-duty review today, but you guys seemed to handle it like champs. Keep it up, yo!


1. **Install Text Editor/FTP software**

	If you weren't able to get it done in class, download and install [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/). I will be teaching off of this app for the rest of the term, and it will make much more sense if we are all on the same page. Trust me, it's worth it.
	
	To get the discount mentioned in class, fill out this [form](http://art341w14.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/panic-psu-discount-cc-form.pdf) and send it to June <june@panic.com> at Panic. She'll get you squared away. You'll need to use your @pdx.edu email address for this to work. (And make *sure* to give a big 'thank you!')


2. **Make a 1-Page, Multiple-Column Interactive Site**

	Starting from the [Web Review](http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/web_review.zip) template, create another site that has multiple columns, styled typography, a clear color scheme, and at least two forms of interaction using jQuery. Post a screenshot and a link of your amazing creation to the blog. 


3. **Start on Project 1**

	Start to think about what narratives you would like to build for project one send at least 3 ideas to the Google Group (aka this mailing list). You can always change your mind later, so just pick some stuff. And if you can't come up with something you like, look at what other people are posting and see if that helps you get any ideas.

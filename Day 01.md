HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Install Coda**

	If you weren't able to get it done in class, download and install [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/). I will be teaching off of this app for the rest of the term, and it will make much more sense if we are all on the same page. Trust me, it's worth it.
	
	To get the discount mentioned in class, fill out this [form](http://art341w14.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/panic-psu-discount-cc-form.pdf) and send it to June <june@panic.com> at Panic. She'll get you squared away. You'll need to use your @pdx.edu email address for this to work. (And make *sure* to give a big 'thank you!')


2. **Start on Project 1**

	Start to think about what you would like to base your Project 1 on. Post at least 3 ideas to the blog. You can always change your mind later, so just pick some stuff.
	

3. **Make 1-Page, Interactive Site**

	Create a one page site, including CSS and at least one jQuery mouse event (you might consider doing hover or double-click), and upload it to your web server. As much as possible, try to do it without just copying and pasting what we did in class today. Make the site look fun and have the interactions do something cool. And make sure it validates!

	Post the URL, along with a screenshot, of your site to WordPress. 

	The site should have this content:
	
		<header>
			Title
			Tag Line
		
			<main nav>
				About
				Resources
				Contact
			</main nav>
				
		</header>

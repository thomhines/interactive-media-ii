### Work Session


HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Finish Designs**

	Finish the designs for *all* of your pages. Don't start coding your site until you've collected all of your content and designed every detail. Yes, you may change your mind later in the process, but the more you decide in Photoshop/Illustrator, the easier it will be to make your site work the first time.

	
2. **Annotated Comps**

	You can either do this on your computer or by printing out your comps and scanning them in (my preferred way, since it is faster), and post them to the blog. Remember, you want to mark up these three things:
	
	- Details such as font, font size, colors, margins, paddings, etc. 
	
	- Define related sections of your site. For instance, group your header info together, and if your main content area has a box inside of it with three text elements and two images, put a div around it to keep them all together.
	
	- Start to label what elements/classes you will use for each section and element (eg. "h1", "header", ".sidebar"). The more you do now, the easier it will be to start coding.
	

3. **Review a Product Website**

	Pick a website that sells a physical product, and review it from a design and marketing perspective. Some questions you might consider answering:

	- What is it trying to sell?
	- How is it communicating the value of the product?
	- How is it communicating the experience the product has to offer?
	- What is the "character" of the product? Does the design help convey that?
	- Is it successfully meeting it's objectives? (Is it convincing?)
	
	Post the URL, a screenshot (or several), and your notes to the blog.

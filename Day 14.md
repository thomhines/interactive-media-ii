1. **Designs All Pages**

	Finish the designs for *all* of your pages. We'll be refining our ideas next week, so they don't have to be done done. Just make sure you have a solid foundation for building your site. And, of course, the more complete the better.


2. **Review a Product Website**

	Pick a website that sells a physical product, and review it from a design and marketing perspective. Some questions you might consider answering:

	- What is it trying to sell?
	- How is it communicating the value of the product?
	- How is it communicating the experience the product has to offer?
	- What is the "character" of the product? Does the design help convey that?
	- Is it successfully meeting it's objectives? (Is it convincing?)
	
	Post the URL, a screenshot (or several), and your notes to the blog.

### Annotated comps



### SVG Images

[Based on CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/using-svg/)
and using [SVG Demo File](http://teaching.thomhines.com/resources/svg_template.zip)


- What are they?

- Why use SVG at all?
	- Small file sizes that compress well
	- Scales to any size without losing clarity (except very tiny)
	- Looks great on retina displays
	- Design control like interactivity and filters

- How do we make them? (Demo this in Illustrator)


<hr>
***NOTE: SVGs don't naturally work on PSU's servers.***

In order to get them to work, you must follow these steps:


1. In Coda, navigate to your 'public_html' folder on the server.
2. In the 'public_html' folder, create a file named '.htaccess'. Note: the filename starts with a period.
3. Paste this into it:

		AddType image/svg+xml svg
		AddType image/svg+xml svgz
		
4. Hit Save

Applying this in your public_html folder will make it so that it works in all of your subfolders, so you shouldn't have to do this again! Nice!


<hr>


We can use SVG files in a few different ways:

- Link to them in an <img> 
	- Fallback: `<img src="image.svg" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='image.png'">`
	
- CSS Backgrounds
	- Must set proper width and height
	-  or use `background: contain;`
	
- Inline
	- Just copy and paste SVG code into HTML
	- PHP includes `<?php include("kiwi.svg"); ?>`
	
		- NOTE: In order for this to work, you have to change your file to .php and you may have to edit your .svg file and remove the first few lines of code (everything before the `<svg>` tag)

- Advanced: Modifying SVG w/ CSS. NOTE: This only works with inline and object-based SVG files
	- By using class names, you can style individual elements within an SVG

###### Break


### Split into groups and go over wireframes. 

10 minutes per student, 2 to explain, 8 to disucss.
[Reapeaterrrr timer](http://repeaterrrr.com/oWTEQf1)

- What is the main objective of your site?
- What are the secondary objectives?
- What is the story you are trying to tell?
- What are the major interactions you want to include in your site?
- How can you involve the user more?
	












HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Design Comps**

	Design and bring in **three (3)** solid directions on the most complex or central page of your site. Stay true to the work you had done with your wireframes, but experiment with color, type, texture, etc. Each direction should feel unique and address the goals you had set for your site stylistically, and each direction should include at least two "states" or moments of interaction/animation. Post them to the blog.

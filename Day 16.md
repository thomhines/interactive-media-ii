1. **Finish Designs**

	Finish the designs for *all* of your pages. Don't start coding your site until you've collected all of your content and designed every detail. Yes, you may change your mind later in the process, but the more you decide in Photoshop/Illustrator, the easier it will be to make your site work the first time.

	
2. **Annotated Comps**

	You can either do this on your computer or by printing out your comps and scanning them in (my preferred way, since it is faster), and post them to the blog. Remember, you want to mark up these three things:
	
	- Details such as font, font size, colors, margins, paddings, etc. 
	
	- Define related sections of your site. For instance, group your header info together, and if your main content area has a box inside of it with three text elements and two images, put a div around it to keep them all together.
	
	- Start to label what elements/classes you will use for each section and element (eg. "h1", "header", ".sidebar"). The more you do now, the easier it will be to start coding.
	
3. **Code**

	This isn't required for next class, but if you have a solid and complete design and a bit of extra time, feel free to start making your HTML/CSS.

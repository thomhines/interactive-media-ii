HW
---------------------------------------
LOOK'N'GOOD! Nice work, everyone. Keep it up, and I'll see you all next week!

1. **Refine Designs**

	Fix all the things that are wrong with your design and make the rest of your pages. I want to see these things pretty much done by next week. We need to move onto HTML/CSS soon, so don't put this off! 


2. **Print Comps**

	You don't have to bring all of your pages, but bring at least two page-sized comps (B&W) to markup as annotated comps next Monday. Ideally, these will be the more complex, info-rich pages so that you will have more to work with.



3. **Codecademy Javascript Lessons**

	Go through the first two series of exercises (under the '[Introduction to Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)' section) on Codecademy. The exercises will guide you through if statements, variables, and so on, as well as a few fun new tools like console.log. Once you're done with these, post a screen shot of the Javascript page with the completed tracks checked off to the blog.

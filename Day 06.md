HW
---------------------------------------
Thanks for suffering through another couple demos today, guys. Hopefully they were of some help. We just have a couple more before the end of the term, so the hard part is almost over.

Quick reminder for next week: We'll be meeting in AB 200 next monday instead of our normal classroom to watch the job talk/lecture for our final GD job candidate. Don't be late!



1. **Refine Designs**

	Fix all the things that are wrong with your design and make the rest of your pages. I want to see these things pretty much done by next week. We need to move onto HTML/CSS soon, so don't put this off! 

2. **Print Comps**

	You don't have to bring all of your pages, but bring at least two full-size comps (B&W) to markup as annotated comps next Monday.

3. **Do CSS Diner**

	Do all the exercises at [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/) and post a screenshot of the final page to the blog. Don't worry; it's fun!


See you all next week!

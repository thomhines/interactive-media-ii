What are some of the things that make these sites effective?:


#### PRODUCT PAGE COPY OUTLINE
Product page is where you sell the value of your product and where the user takes action (adds to cart, sign up, makes a purchase, etc.).

1. Name of the product.
2. Value proposition: what’s the end-benefit of this product and who is it for?
3. Specific and clear overview of what the product does and why is that good (features and benefits).
4. What’s the pain that it solves? Description of the problem.
5. List of everything in the product (e.g. curriculum of the course, list of every item in the package, etc.).
6. Technical information: parameters, what do you get and how does it work?
7. Objection handling. Make a list of all possible FUDs (fears, uncertainties, doubts) and address them. ([Karma Tour Page](https://yourkarma.com/tour): they reinforce the idea that somebody else using your hotspot is NOT using your data plan)
8. Bonuses (what you get on top of the offer).
<!--9. Money-back guarantee (+ return policy).-->
10. Price.
11. Call to action.
12. Expectation setting: what happens after you buy? (Nest is


#### General Tips

1. NOT TOO MUCH TEXT 
	
	> Tests have shown that 79% of people don’t read, they just skim. However, 16% read everything.
	
	> Those 16% are your main target group, the most interested people. If people are not interested in what you are selling, it doesn’t matter how long or short your sales copy is. If they are interested, you should give them as much information as possible.

2. AVOID JARGON AND BLANDVERTISING
3. BE SPECIFIC
4. IT HAS TO BE ABOUT THEM


What you now have in place is like a skeleton. Next step would be to start writing the draft version of the copy by filling in the blanks.





### To prepare for group discussions, answer these questions individually:
- What is the primary objective of your product? Does it help people achieve other goals?
- What are its main interactions? Secondary?
- Who is your audience? Why do they use it? Why *don't* they use it?
- What is important to know about your product? What is most convincing/evocative about it?
- What kinds of interactions would make sense for a site about your product?
- What is the overall tone that you want to convey in your site?




### Sketchboarding - 20 min


### Group discussions





HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Post Wireframes**

	First, if you didn't finish your 6 wireframes today in class, finish them. Then post them to the blog. Remember to add any notes or sketches that will help you remember your ideas for the design stage!	


2. **Research/Mood Boards**
	
	It doesn't have to be a 'board', but I want to see at least 20 pieces of aesthetic inspiration. This could include imagery, texture, type, color, etc. At least three of your directions should be other sites that feature something you would like to emulate in your product site. For these three sites, write a brief description about why you like it in the context of this project. Bonus points if anybody shares good resources or sites for finding well designed product sites with the email list.


3. **Design Comps**
	
	Create three distinct directions of how you might want your site to work. They don't have to be finalized, but as always, the more you do now, the less you'll have to work or stress later. You can do just one page for each direction, but be sure to show enough that you can capture the feel of your design and the page structure from your wireframes in that one page.

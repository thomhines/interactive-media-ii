	- [Karma](https://yourkarma.com/)

What are some of the things that make these sites effective?:


#### PRODUCT PAGE COPY OUTLINE
Product page is where you sell the value of your product and where the user takes action (adds to cart, sign up, makes a purchase, etc.).

1. Name of the product.
2. Value proposition: what’s the end-benefit of this product and who is it for?
3. Specific and clear overview of what the product does and why is that good (features and benefits).
4. What’s the pain that it solves? Description of the problem.
5. List of everything in the product (e.g. curriculum of the course, list of every item in the package, etc.).
6. Technical information: parameters, what do you get and how does it work?
7. Objection handling. Make a list of all possible FUDs (fears, uncertainties, doubts) and address them. ([Karma Tour Page](https://yourkarma.com/tour): they reinforce the idea that somebody else using your hotspot is NOT using your data plan)
8. Bonuses (what you get on top of the offer).
<!--9. Money-back guarantee (+ return policy).-->
10. Price.
11. Call to action.
12. Expectation setting: what happens after you buy? (Nest is


#### General Tips

1. NOT TOO MUCH TEXT 
	
	> Tests have shown that 79% of people don’t read, they just skim. However, 16% read everything.
	
	> Those 16% are your main target group, the most interested people. If people are not interested in what you are selling, it doesn’t matter how long or short your sales copy is. If they are interested, you should give them as much information as possible.

2. AVOID JARGON AND BLANDVERTISING
3. BE SPECIFIC
4. IT HAS TO BE ABOUT THEM


What you now have in place is like a skeleton. Next step would be to start writing the draft version of the copy by filling in the blanks.





### To prepare for group discussions, answer these questions individually:
- What is the primary objective of your product? Does it help people achieve other goals?
- What are its main interactions? Secondary?
- Who is your audience? Why do they use it? Why *don't* they use it?
- What is important to know about your product? What is most convincing/evocative about it?
- What kinds of interactions would make sense for a site about your product?
- What is the overall tone that you want to convey in your site?




### Sketchboarding - 20 min

HW
---------------------------------------

Hey all,

Before we head into the weekend, I just wanted to make sure that I gave you guys the homework in email form. It's the exact same thing I mentioned in class, but not everybody was there.

1. **Wireframes**

	Three sets of wireframes, and each of these should be much more comprehensive and detailed than the ones you did for project 1. (I don't mean detailed as in adding shading or little pictures to the wireframes. I mean that you should be thorough in what content you're using, where it goes, how much space it will take up, what kinds of animations and interactions you expect to use, etc.). Then do it two more times with different layouts and interaction ideas. Post these to the blog.

2. **Moodboards**
	
	Find at least 20 pieces of inspiration for your project 2 product site. I would recommend finding several sites that do things you'd like to emulate, and one or more of these has to be a product site that showcases and sells a product in a compelling way. Print these out in addition to posting them to the blog.

3. **Rough Comps**

	Using your wireframes and moodboards, start to play around with the look and feel of your sites. Don't worry about fine tuning at this point, I want you to explore a breadth of design options in low fidelity. Create at least three distinct, rough design directions (one page each) by next class.

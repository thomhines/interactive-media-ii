### Work Session



HW
---------------------------------------
Beautiful sites today, guys! I'm really thrilled with how much you were able to accomplish! You should feel good about it. 

Fortunately, not too much homework for tonight. Please post all of this to the blog, and if you have any questions, send them to the group and I'll be happy to help however I can!

Have a great evening, everyone.



1. **Self/Project Evaluation**
	
	Please write a couple of paragraphs to the blog reflecting on how you feel Project 1 went. You can focus on what you learned, what you liked, what you hated, the project itselfâ€¦ Just help me get a sense of what you think of Project 1 now that we're *mostly* done with it.
	

2. **Pick a Product for Project 2**
	
	I've posted the Project 2 brief to the resources page, so hopefully anybody confused about my description of project 2 can get a better sense of what we're looking for. By next class, I want you to pick out the product that you will be basing your Project 2 site on. When picking a product, think about what kinds of interactions you have with it as you use it. Ideally, the product you pick will have a deep, rich, and hopefully fun interaction. And just in case your top idea doesn't work out, I would like for you post two back-up ideas (three product ideas total) to the blog. For each product idea, come up with three significant interactions that are essential to the use of your product and how you might translate those to the web. Feel free to check [unheap](http://www.unheap.com/) to find ideas.

Javascript basics:
- What do we call the thing that lets us store a value in code (eg. "username" from last class)? (variable)
- How do we ask for user input when we need them to give a yes/no answer? (the confirm() function)
- [Codepen](http://codepen.io/thomhines/pen/kELIo)
	- How can we run one set of code only when certain conditions are met in our code? (the if() statement)
	- And how can we run other code when that statement is false?
	- What if we need to check for multiple conditions? (else if, &&, and ||)


### Work Session



HW
---------------------------------------
1. **Refine Design**
	
	Take care of any last minute changes you have to make. Really, you should be done with this, but I know how designers are, so just do what you can to wrap things up. THERE SHOULD BE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. Take a deep breath, hit Save, and move on.

2. **Finish HTML and Basic CSS**
	
	All of your HTML should be done, and enough CSS that your site looks recognizable. If there are some things that are broken or some obscure styles that aren't in place, no biggie, but you want to be as close to done as you can be. Upload your work-in-progress site and post a link to the blog.

2. **Begin Working With Javascript**
	
	Don't wait for next class to get started playing with your interactions. Set up your .js file, load up jQuery, and try getting the hang of all the plugins you might want to use. No doubt people will run into problems so better to run into them sooner rather than later!

HW
---------------------------------------

Just a quick reminder for those of you who weren't in class today: no class on Wednesday. I'll be in the middle of doing Sophomore Portfolio Review. If you have any technical questions, PLEASE ask the group first and I'll get back to you if nobody else responds quickly enough.
 

1. **Finish Project 2**

	This one is pretty self-evident. Push it!


2. **Self-Reflection**

	Before the final, I would like you all to write 2-3 paragraphs on how you felt this project went, what you would have changed about the project brief, how you would have done it differently, what you feel proud of, etc. In addition to helping me understand how you feel about the project, it's also a good chance to collect your thoughts about what you want to say during next week's final crits (which will be next Thursday 12:30pm).


3. **Teacher Evaluations**

	If you haven't done so already, I'd also really like if you could take the time to take care of your teacher evaluations before the end of the week! 


Have a great week and I'll see you all at the Final! Good luck, everyone!

### WORK DAY!

Remember to give students time to do evaluations


	


HW
---------------------------------------

As mentioned in class, there is one more thing that I want you guys to do before you consider yourselves done in my class. Please take the time to fill out this self/team evaluation form. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes, but it will be part of the basis for determining the 30% of your Project 2 grade that deals with your individual contributions to the team. In fact, this evaluation is so important that I won't be giving you a grade for the class unless you fill it in! And in case it wasn't clear, everybody should fill this out, not just one person per team.

Make sure to have these done by next Monday at the latest. I'll be doing grading first thing Tuesday morning, and you don't want to be late.

It was a fun class this term, and I enjoyed having you all there! I hope you guys got something out of it, too. 

Enjoy your summer! Take care!

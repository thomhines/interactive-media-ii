PREP
---------------------------------------



CLASS
---------------------------------------

### Housecleaning
- Discuss how to do better JS debugging
	- Network/Net Panel - See if files are loading
	- If files are loading, use JSHint, which is part of the PHP & Web Toolkit plugin - See if there are any errors





### Product Site Reviews

- Did anybody have a site they particularly liked?
	- What is good about this site?
	- Did it make you want to explore the site more?
	- Did it make you more or less interested in the product itself?

- How about sites that 	didn't work?
	- What is bad about this site?
	- If you didn't have to do this assignment, would you have stayed on this site?
	- Did it make you more or less interested in the product itself?


	
### Group crits while I meet with students one-on-one
Have students show their annotated comps and discuss their plans for programming. Encourage them to give each other advice on how best to put it together, with a particular focus on what goes inside of divs (what goes with what?)

### Work Session


HW
---------------------------------------

1. **Refine Designs**

	Finish the designs for *all* of your pages. Don't start coding your site until you've collected all of your content and designed every detail. Yes, you may change your mind later in the process, but the more you decide in Photoshop/Illustrator, the easier it will be to make your site work the first time.

	
2. **Annotated Comps**

	You can either do this on your computer or by printing out your comps and scanning them in (my preferred way, since it is faster), and post them to the blog. Remember, you want to mark up these three things:
	
	- Details such as font, font size, colors, margins, paddings, etc. 
	
	- Define related sections of your site. For instance, group your header info together, and if your main content area has a box inside of it with three text elements and two images, put a div around it to keep them all together.
	
	- Start to label what elements/classes you will use for each section and element (eg. "h1", "header", ".sidebar"). The more you do now, the easier it will be to start coding.
	
3. **Code**

	This isn't required for next class, but if you have a solid and complete design and a bit of extra time, feel free to start making your HTML/CSS. Do NOT start working on javascript stuff until you have your HTML/CSS foundation.

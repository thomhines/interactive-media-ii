HW
---------------------------------------
Good thing we're done with these candidate lectures just as we're starting to code! We'll be doing one more demo this week, but for the rest of the project we'll be focusing on developing the sites you've been designing. We still have a while before this project is due, but don't slow down now! The hardest and most time consuming parts almost always come at the end.


1. **Annotated Comps**

	Remember, the three things that you should mark up in your annotated comps are:
		- Details: type, color, sizes, margins, etc.
		- Structure: sections and divs
		- Labeling: Pick which elements/class names to use for each block on the page


2. **HTML/CSS**

	If you haven't already started on it, now is the time to start coding this thing. You should have your HTML done for all of your pages by next class (don't worry! Like always, you can change it later), and if you have time, start working on your CSS.


3. **Codecademy Javascript Lessons**

	Go through the first two series of exercises (under the '[Introduction to Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)' section) on Codecademy. The exercises will guide you through if statements, variables, and so on, as well as a few fun new tools like console.log. Once you're done with these, post a screen shot of the Javascript page with the completed tracks checked off to the blog.
